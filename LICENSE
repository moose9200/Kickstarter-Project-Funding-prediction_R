Hello Saurav,
we ran the notebook persona_cluster_asignment using both dataset Tier1_raw_base_1 (post) and  Tier1_raw_base_1_WithdriverID (pre) and found that all the visits are falling under cluster 5 only.
everything looks fine not able to find the issue would be great if you can look into it. 
refer notebook persona_cluster_asignment(1) in adrija's workspace.
